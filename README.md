# Brain-MRI-Segmentation
###  Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI Images using Deep Learning.
Brain tumor segmentation is the process of separating the tumor from normal brain tissues; in clinical routine, it provides useful information for diagnosis and treatment planning. Timely diagnosis of brain tumors is thus vital to ensuring appropriate treatment planning, surgery, and follow-up visits . As a popular non-invasive technique Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) produces markedly different types of tissue contrast and has thus been widely used by radiologists to diagnose brain tumors  However, the manual segmentation of brain tumors from MRI images is both subjective and time-consuming. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design automatic and robust brain tumor segmentation tools.
